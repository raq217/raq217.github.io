--Assignment #1: Website Documentation

Making this website was my first hand experience with html and CSS. It took me some while to get used to the code at first and understand the functions to execute what I wanted with the website so that it could resemble my wireframe. 

Accomplishments:
- Managed to work with pages and develop them with proper content/information. I was very clueless on how to do it but I managed to figure it out in the end. 
- Establish a layout that resembled my wireframe. It was hard to do this with the html with no prior experience but it worked out.
- Getting familiar with html as a whole. My website was very simple but I am happy with what I learnt during the process.

Challenges:
- As I said in the start, getting the pages to work was hard but I figured the problem which was really simple (href=).
- One of the challenges I could not resolve was having an interactive slider on the "About Us" page because the slider kept on glitching and would only show one person. I didn't have the time to figure out what was the problem and this was the most frustrating part of the project.
- I wanted to make the dimensions more 'aesthetically pleasing' by making text boxes instead of having to read across one side to the other. My issue was that the ,<p> code wouldn't allow for it which I tried to find a solution for but couldn't.

Over all, this was my first introduction to HTML/CSS and it was an experience. It took a lot of time to get used to the code itself and full understand it but it was worth it in the end. I am more confident in my ability to create another more advanced website after this one or even make changes to the current one. There were a lot of frustrating moments that involved minor mistakes such as missing a dash or a semi-colon so I've learnt to be more careful with code in general. Hopefully in the next assignment that requires code I'll be able to produce a better result comfortably. 


--Mid term project:

This assignment involved the creation of a web-comic. It was quite challegning at the start to reciprocate the envisioned plans/story line of the comic because of the animations we wanted to use. However, through some hard group work we managed to successfully have a final product that we were satisfied with.

Accomplishments:
- Managed to work with SVG and Illustrator to render layouts that would fit the layout we wanted for the comic.
- Scripted animations for the clouds and planes. In my opinion, this is the biggest accomplishment for me while doing this project. Since I am relatively new to html and CSS, this was a challenging part. After numerous attemps we managed to replicate the animations we envisioned.
- Learning how to use Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop with others which helped to develop team working skills. 

Challenges:
- A challenge I faced was working with the text on the code and Illustrator. There were many instances where when the panels were uploaded, the text would break format and words would be split in half. This was very annoying and resulted in multiple edits of the indiviudal SVGs. After some recurrent fixes of the spacing and text box sizes I managed to fix this problem. In total I have 50+ SVG files because of this. 
- Another challenge that I encountered was a break in the script when the animations were added. This mainly focused on the <mainContainer> aspect of the code. The issue was that the animations would not load the next panel or only load half of the next city.
- One of the challenges that I could not figure out was a layout/publishing issue (still trying to figure). It would work on one device and then mess up on another. I am really confused on how to fix this.
  
In summary, compared to the previous project I feel that my coding skills have improved greatly. I am much more confident with my ability to code animations, which was something I was very new with at the start of this project. I really enjoyed working with other group members as we could easily go to each other if we needed any assistance with anything. This project was a lot more fun than the previous one as I was more comfortable and confident with myself while coding. I look forward to the next project.
