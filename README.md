--Assignment #1: Website Documentation

Making this website was my first hand experience with html and CSS. It took me some while to get used to the code at first and understand the functions to execute what I wanted with the website so that it could resemble my wireframe. 

Accomplishments:
- Managed to work with pages and develop them with proper content/information. I was very clueless on how to do it but I managed to figure it out in the end. 
- Establish a layout that resembled my wireframe. It was hard to do this with the html with no prior experience but it worked out.
- Getting familiar with html as a whole. My website was very simple but I am happy with what I learnt during the process.

Challenges:
- As I said in the start, getting the pages to work was hard but I figured the problem which was really simple (href=).
- One of the challenges I could not resolve was having an interactive slider on the "About Us" page because the slider kept on glitching and would only show one person. I didn't have the time to figure out what was the problem and this was the most frustrating part of the project.
- I wanted to make the dimensions more 'aesthetically pleasing' by making text boxes instead of having to read across one side to the other. My issue was that the ,<p> code wouldn't allow for it which I tried to find a solution for but couldn't.

Over all, this was my first introduction to HTML/CSS and it was an experience. It took a lot of time to get used to the code itself and full understand it but it was worth it in the end. I am more confident in my ability to create another more advanced website after this one or even make changes to the current one. There were a lot of frustrating moments that involved minor mistakes such as missing a dash or a semi-colon so I've learnt to be more careful with code in general. Hopefully in the next assignment that requires code I'll be able to produce a better result comfortably. 


--Mid term project:

This assignment involved the creation of a web-comic. It was quite challegning at the start to reciprocate the envisioned plans/story line of the comic because of the animations we wanted to use. However, through some hard group work we managed to successfully have a final product that we were satisfied with.

Accomplishments:
- Managed to work with SVG and Illustrator to render layouts that would fit the layout we wanted for the comic.
- Scripted animations for the clouds and planes. In my opinion, this is the biggest accomplishment for me while doing this project. Since I am relatively new to html and CSS, this was a challenging part. After numerous attemps we managed to replicate the animations we envisioned.
- Learning how to use Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop with others which helped to develop team working skills. 

Challenges:
- A challenge I faced was working with the text on the code and Illustrator. There were many instances where when the panels were uploaded, the text would break format and words would be split in half. This was very annoying and resulted in multiple edits of the indiviudal SVGs. After some recurrent fixes of the spacing and text box sizes I managed to fix this problem. In total I have 50+ SVG files because of this. 
- Another challenge that I encountered was a break in the script when the animations were added. This mainly focused on the <mainContainer> aspect of the code. The issue was that the animations would not load the next panel or only load half of the next city.
- One of the challenges that I could not figure out was a layout/publishing issue (still trying to figure). It would work on one device and then mess up on another. I am really confused on how to fix this.
  
In summary, compared to the previous project I feel that my coding skills have improved greatly. I am much more confident with my ability to code animations, which was something I was very new with at the start of this project. I really enjoyed working with other group members as we could easily go to each other if we needed any assistance with anything. This project was a lot more fun than the previous one as I was more comfortable and confident with myself while coding. I look forward to the next project.


--Audio visuals project:

For this project I worked with Soojin on composing a visual piece that uses audios that we recorded around the campus. Our main mission was to approach an audience of students NYUAD and the freshmen that were unable to be on campus this semester due to COVID-19 restrictions. We wanted to provide an insight into what campus life is currently like. The appearance of the website was to remain simple and professional so that it can look like a reliable source of information. Both coding the website and making the video were tasks that took a lot of time and reworking on, but we managed to complete an end product that we were proud of. 

Challenges:
- Recording the audio for the video took a majority of our time because we had to isolate the environment around us. This included turning off nearby appliances and contacting Public Safety to turn off lights and the air conditioning. This was mainly done to improve the quality and normalization of the audio through the editing process. The platform we used to edit the audios was Audacity because we had prior experience with it and it was the application we were most comfortable with. It was very useful to have Kristen's advice on how to improve the sound through techniques such as normalization and pitch editing. 
- Another challenge we faced was making sure that the visual content matched the audio and was comprehensive with the flow of the storyline. With some advice from the professor we managed to improve this greatly. At first, we thought we wouldn't have enough time to make the right edits but we managed to pull through. To me this was one of the greatest concerns for this project.

Accomplishments:
- I am quite happy with how the website had turned out. This is my first class on working with HTML and I feel that my skills have improved greatly from the first website I made. We managed to intergrate some elements of interactivity which we had never done before this class and it turned out smoothly. Additionally, the way in which we layed out the code seemed to be a lot better than the past assignments, which made us more confident for the future projects to come. The hovering addition to the website was soemthing new to both of us and it was a process to learn, but we managed to nail it in the end. 
- In the time frame we were given to make the changes to the video, I was quite proud with the end product. There was a lot of editing and recording that had to be done to make sure that the video flowed. Soojin and I managed to work together quite well under such constraints and it really showed how teamwork is very important in these group projects. We managed to stick with the plan we had in the beginning and it was satisfying to see us check the boxes that we both wanted.

In conclusion, this was a great time testing experience with both HTML/CSS and Audacity. By working together we managed to teach ourselves new skills and find out the mistakes we were making with the code, which in my opinion is the best way to learn code. I look forward to using the things I learnt in this project on the next one. 


--Assignment 4: LSFR

For the last group project we decided to go with making a AI responsive product called LSFR which was inspired by existing ideas of Alexa and the Echo dot. The main drive of this project was to create a marketing strategy for our mock up product which went by the names Levon and Eiry. We decided to go with these names as they are broad and not gender specific, allowing us to target a greater audience. This worked well with the times of COVID that we currently live in as everyone is isolated and having a friend that you can take anywhere with you at all times seemed like a great visionary idea. The process included three crucial steps; 1) making the actual product with styrofoam 2) the filiming of our promotional video and 3) making a website to advertise it on. 

Challenges: 
- One of the challenges we faced as a group was making the product and using it in our videos. We faced several issues in ironing out any options/ideas that would lead to controversy within our product, e.g; having specified genders or skintones for the product. 
- Working with the audios was a difficulty we faced in the filming process. Originally we wanted to keep the audios as they were in the video but then we decided that if we used voice overs then it would sound more realistic and personal with the viewer - putting them in the shoes of the actors in the video. This was extremely time consuming and took many takes/hours to perfect along with other people we asked to voice over for the box. 
- Personally the biggest challenge I faced was the code and implementing the javascript. I never worked with motion related to .js and it took a really long time to get a hang of what I was working with. The product page of the website was the hardest component of the whole project as we wanted to use many futures like audios and color changes to allow the user to design their own product. One of the primary issues with this part was incorporating the audios of different languages in the html code. We wanted to select either Levon or Eiry and then be able to select what language the box would be, but the code was too complex for us to work with. Thankfully we managed to come up with another alternative around it which was to include the options together instead of having them separate. I really wish we could have added the slider to each color but I do agree with point that it would've been a bit overkill (I guess this was a blessing in disguise?).
- Uploading to Github was another issue as our video was around 800MB which is too big to be upload with the code. I managed to compress the video slightly and upload it to Vimeo which managed to resolve the problem.

Accomplishments:
- Working on this project included a lot of visions that I did not expect to meet. My first website in this class had no javarscript or interactive element within the code and was very simple. Now I have managed to script a website that the audience can connect with and have fun with in a simple manner. At first I was trying to avoid working with any javascript as I was completely inexperienced in it, but I took a different path and combatted this worry. Fatima and I managed to work together to find ways to use .js in our code by learning through the process. 
- Not only did I develop my coding skills with this project, I managed to grasp what companies have to think about before making/launching a product. Since our site was a marketing strategy we had to brainstorm the dos and don'ts as if we were actual entrepenuers. It was interesting to weave in different skills and abilities from outside of class into our project. 

Overall, there were many hurdles in completing this assignment and there were times where I wanted to give up and would worry about dragging my team down due to my knowledge of HTML/Javascript. Especially with my other finals I began to doubt myself in the making of the website but with teamwork we managed to pull through with what we planned and wanted. We surprisingly stuck closely with our wireframe and had to barely make any great changes to it which was nice to see towards the end as it felt like we accomplished something. I do think I was lucky that my teammates were on campus with me in this project we would have not achieved as much as we did if we weren't all together physcially. As we wrap up this course I can say I am proud with myself and how far I have come. I cannot wait to use the skills I learnt from this class in my future courses.
