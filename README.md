Assignment #1: Website Documentation

Making this website was my first hand experience with html and CSS. It took me some while to get used to the code at first and understand the functions to execute what I wanted with the website so that it could resemble my wireframe. 

Accomplishments:
- Managed to work with pages and develop them with proper content/information. I was very clueless on how to do it but I managed to figure it out in the end. 
- Establish a layout that resembled my wireframe. It was hard to do this with the html with no prior experience but it worked out.
- Getting familiar with html as a whole. My website was very simple but I am happy with what I learnt during the process.

Challenges:
- As I said in the start, getting the pages to work was hard but I figured the problem which was really simple (href=).
- One of the challenges I could not resolve was having an interactive slider on the "About Us" page because the slider kept on glitching and would only show one person. I didn't have the time to figure out what was the problem and this was the most frustrating part of the project.
- I wanted to make the dimensions more 'aesthetically pleasing' by making text boxes instead of having to read across one side to the other. My issue was that the ,<p> code wouldn't allow for it which I tried to find a solution for but couldn't.

Over all, this was my first introduction to HTML/CSS and it was an experience. It took a lot of time to get used to the code itself and full understand it but it was worth it in the end. I am more confident in my ability to create another more advanced website after this one or even make changes to the current one. There were a lot of frustrating moments that involved minor mistakes such as missing a dash or a semi-colon so I've learnt to be more careful with code in general. Hopefully in the next assignment that requires code I'll be able to produce a better result comfortably.
