            This website is all about our films that we have produced during the fall semester of 2020. This is part of our creative zone where we are able to showcase our projects online through creating websites with CSS and HTML. As a group of four people we have managed to make a film in an hour; 30 minutes for filiming and 30 minutes for editing. It was a time-constraining experience.
