        One of our first projects:

        Thought process:
        <p>
            The idea we had behind this film is having 3 students (Ishmal, Amina, Hessa) get ready to go to D2, our local dining area. Unfortunately, a robber (Rashid) prevents them from doing so by breaking into their dorm.

            The project itself took one hour to make with one half being dedicated for making the flim and the other half for editing.

        <p>Thanks to Ishmal for a major part in the editing!
